**Design**
1. Introduction: A New Realm of Productivity
Unveil a world where tasks aren't a chore, but a thrilling quest in our everyday adventure. Our application mashes the meticulous organization of a task list with the heart-throbbing excitement of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. It's not just a to-do list; it's an experience. A place where ticking off daily tasks feeds our in-game character, evolving them into a formidable force. This app is designed to fuel the motivations of the goal-getters, the dream-chasers, and those yearning for a spark of fun in their daily routine.
2. User Interface: Elegantly Minimal, Cleverly Detailed
Dressed in a minimalist coat, the app sports a slick and polished appearance. We take sophistication seriously, ensuring that power-packed functionality is served with simplicity and elegance. The journey is frustration-free with key features strategically placed just a tap away.
Task List: Our daily battleground. Here, we'll manage tasks, launch attacks on deadlines, and claim victory as we check off completed missions.
Time Blocking: A strategic map of our day. Divide and conquer time, assigning tasks to each conquered block.
Settings: Our control room. Customize our app interface, manage user preferences and account settings to ensure a smooth and personalized journey.
Character: The heart of our game. Watch our character grow, invest in their development, explore adventure mode, town mode and more.
3. User Stories and Features: Interactivity Meets Rewards
On this platform, every tap brings we a step closer to a reward. Set a task, earn points. Complete a task, earn points. Every interaction is designed to feed into the reward loop, making progress visible and satisfying.
Task Setting & Completion: The crux of our journey. Where tasks are not just tasks; they're quests leading to rich rewards.
Reward Investment & Progress Tracking: Revel in the joy of seeing our character evolve and our game progress as we invest our well-earned rewards.
4. Game Design: Play, Progress, and Prosper
Welcome to the gamified realm where points are both the journey and the destination. Earn them by setting up and completing tasks, then spend them on crafting our game experience. Upgrade our character, build our town, and embark on thrilling adventures. Remember, this is more than a game; it's our task-conquering journey coming to life.
5. Database Design: Building Blocks of Our Adventure
Every piece of data is a building block in our journey. Task history forms the backbone of our progress, user profiles add a personal touch, and game stats add the thrill of achievement. Each data point serves a purpose, fueling our adventure, shaping our experience, and creating a journey that's uniquely ours.
6. System Architecture: The Invisible Conductor
Our back-end is the invisible conductor of this symphony, ensuring the music never stops. It handles data processing, and ensures seamless sync between devices. And when it comes to external services, we believe in standing on the shoulders of giants. We'll integrate free, open-source third-party services wherever it aids our adventure.
7. Technology Stack: Powering Our Quest
The power behind our quest? A harmony of React Native for the front-end and Node.js with Express.js for the back-end. These technologies form the epicenter of our app, powering our journey from the core.
8. Development Timeline: An Adventure at Our Pace
No daunting deadlines, no race against time. This is an adventure at our pace. We're starting with the essentials - the to-do list and gamification - followed by time blocking and settings. But every step forward adds another layer to our experience.
9. Budget: A Journey Within Means
As a side project, this journey doesn't come with a hefty price tag. The focus is on creating an immersive, rewarding experience without breaking the bank. The budget is reserved for what truly matters - a robust hosting environment and necessary tools that keep our journey smooth and uninterrupted.

**Project Structure**
Organizing our project well will make it easier to maintain and develop as it grows. Here's a simple, scalable way we might structure our project:
/DoToWin
  /src
    /assets       // For storing images, fonts, etc.
    /components   // For reusable components like buttons, inputs, etc.
    /screens      // Each screen of the app gets its own file here
    /navigation   // Our React Navigation setup
    /store        // Our Redux setup
    /services     // Any utility functions or services we might create
    /api          // If we have any network requests, they'd go here
  App.js          // Our root component
